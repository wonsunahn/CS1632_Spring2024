This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software
testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing theory, the
emphasis is on providing practical skills in software testing currently used in
industry. To that end, it will cover: manual and automated tests, test-driven
development, performance testing, and model checking.

This lecture will use the **flipped classroom** learning model.  All lectures
(except the introductury lectures and guest lectures) will be pre-recorded and
posted on Canvas.  It is your responsibility to keep up with the lectures
according to the [Schedule](schedule.md).  There will be eight in-class
exercises to apply what you learned during the lectures and to prepare you for
the deliverables.

## Grading

* Projects (70%):
  * Deliverable 1 - 10%
  * Deliverable 2 - 15%
  * Deliverable 3 - 15%
  * Deliverable 4 - 15%
  * Deliverable 5 - 15%
* Midterms (20%):
  * Midterm 1 - 10%
  * Midterm 2 - 10%
* Participation (10%)
  * TopHat attendance
  * TopHat lecture questions
  * Exercise submissions (satisfactory / unsatisfactory)
  * Teams participation

TopHat questions will be asked in class on days where there are lectures
assigned as Prerequisites on the [Schedule](schedule.md), on Tuesday at the
beginning of each week.  You are expected to have listened to the lectures
before coming to class on Canvas Panopto.  You will be given one minute to answer each question.
0.5 points are participation points and 0.5 points are correctness points for
each 1 point per question.  I will also assign TopHat questions that we
don't have time to cover in class as homework you have to do before coming to class. 

Exams will NOT be allowed to be made up except with a valid and verified excuse
(generally medical - others are left to the discretion of the instructor).

The following grading scale will be used.  Note that I generally do _not_ round
grades up.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-93.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
92.99-90.00  | A-
89.99-87.00  | B+
86.99-83.00  | B
82.99-80.00  | B-
79.99-77.00  | C+
76.99-73.00  | C
72.99-70.00  | C-
69.99-67.00  | D+
66.99-63.00  | D
62.99-60.00  | D-
59.99-0.00   | F

## Group Work

One of the learning goals of this class is to learn to collaborate effectively
as part of a team using tools like git repositories, code live sharing, and
Teams communication.  You are highly encouraged to find and work with a
partner.  If you cannot find a partner you would like to work with, then you
are allowed to work alone.

Either way, please submit the Partnership Contract on GradeScope.  Your
expectations as a group member are outlined clearly on the contract.  You may
resubmit the contract at a later time, at which time the new contract will come
into effect.  All exercises (except the very first Java Assessment Exercise)
and deliverables will be done as group work in this class.

## Excercise Details

Exercises are unscored, as in the score that you get on GradeScope will not be
factored into your grade.  As long as you didn't get a 0 score (or you didn't
submit), your exercise will be marked as complete and be counted towards your
participation score.  You will get credit if you submit "satisfactory" work.
By satisfactory, I mean you did not just submit the skeleton code and you put
reasonable effort into doing the exercise.  

The purpose of the exercises are to prepare you for the deliverables and get
feedback on mistakes you made so that you don't make the same mistakes on your
deliverables.  Since exercises are unscored, you are free to discuss them with
your classmates, including sharing each other's code.

Exercises will be **released on Monday** in class.  You will be given time
in-class on Monday to complete it and if you don't, you can keep working on
it on Thursday as well.  On Wedneday, we will discuss the exercise and you
will have a chance to ask questions if you had any difficulties.  This is
also the day when the deliverable associated with the exercise will be
released (if any).  You can finish up the exercise and **submit by Friday
midnight**.

* **Exercise 0:** Java assessment exercise
* **Exercises 1-5:** Exercises that prepare you for the corresponding deliverable
* **Supplementary Exercises 1-4:** Supplementary exercises that are unrelated to a deliverable

## Deliverable Details

All deliverables are scored and constitute the bulk of the grade for the class.
By the time you start on the deliverable, you would have done the corresponding
exercise so you should be well prepared (in theory).  If you still have
questions, please ask your instructor.  Plese do not discuss your solutions or
share your code with your classmates --- you have the exercises for that purpose.

* **Deliverable 1:** Developing a test plan and traceability matrix for a system.
* **Deliverable 2:** Developing unit tests for a console-based application.
* **Deliverable 3:** Developing a simple web application system with the help of automated systems testing.
* **Deliverable 4:** Performance testing and optimization of an application.
* **Deliverable 5:** Developing and testing an application using both static and dynamic testing.

## Assignment submission

All exercises and deliverables will be submitted using GradeScope.

Most assignments will be done in a GitHub Classroom repository.  The repository
will allow you to collaborate effectively with your partner and also keep a
history of all past modifications for versioning purposes.  The repository can
be submitted in its entirety to GradeScope.  Make sure you commit and push your
changes before submitting.  

You are encourged to commit early and often to the repository as commit history
will be used as the ground truth for proof of work (especially as it relates to
a group project).  Also, frequent commits help avoid version conflicts when
working on the same files as your partner.  If any disputes from groups arise,
I will assume that GitHub is the "ground truth".  For example, if Partner A
insists that they did all the work, but GitHub history shows only commits by
Partner B, I will assume that Partner B has done all the work.  Please keep
your repository **private** at all times to prevent plagiarism.

Some assignments require write-ups that need to be submitted to GradeScope.
The format of the write-up will be specified on each assignment.  To
collaborate on these write-ups, it may be easier to use cloud shared docs (such
as Goodle Docs).

All exercises are expected to be submitted on time, for the purposes of timely feedback.
Late deliverables will receive a -5 percentage point penalty per day (e.g., if
you would have received a 90% on a deliverable, but you turned it in 3 days
late, you would receive 90 - 15 = 75%.).  

## Programming Language Selection

For all deliverables, the class will use Java with the appropriate frameworks (JUnit, Mockito, Selenium).  Projects written in other languages or using alternative frameworks will not be accepted.

## Participating in Class

Questions and comments are invited and strongly encouraged.  If you have a view
point or experience that may enrich the class, please jump in!  There are
several ways you can participate:

1. In-class

    If you are in-person and you have a question, just interrupt me and
interject.  Raising your hand is optional.  

2. Offline

    Please use the Teams "Posts" tab on the "General" channel if you have a
general question or comment.  If you have a question about a specific topic for
which there is a dedicated channel, please use that channel.  For example,
there is currently a "Partner Exchange" channel besides the "General" channel,
so please use that channel to broadcast messages about partners.  Remember, you
are encouraged to answer as well as ask questions!  I will give a thumbs up on
verified answers or I will add a few more things if needed.  

    You can easily DM me or one of your classmates using Teams.  Again, select
the class in the "Teams" menu and then click on the "..." context menu beside
the "CS 1632 Software Quality Assurance" team name.  Please select the top-most
item: "Manage Team".  There, you should be able to see the statuses of all
students in the class, and if you hover over the name of any student, you
should see options to initiate a chat, email, or a call with that individual.

3. Email / Canvas messages

    For the fastest response, please use Teams chat.

When you ask a source-code-specific question about an exercise or deliverable,
please submit your code to GradeScope first so that I can reproduce your error.
Also, describe precisely the steps I should take to reproduce your error.
Before you do this, it is very hard for me to help you.

I will try to get back to all offline communications within 24 hours of
receipt.  Even if I'm logged onto Teams, please understand that I may be away
from my desk or working on something else.  Meanwhile, feel free to answer each
other's questions!

## In-Person Attendance

This is fully in-person class.  I will allow remote participation only in the
following two exceptional circumstances:

_1. If you have a family or medical emergency that would cause you to miss
class.  Rather than miss class, if you are able to participate over Zoom, I
will allow it._

_2. If you have to quarantine due to contact with COVID.  Either you have a
positive test result or you are waiting for test results._

For the above exceptions, I will create Zoom sessions on demand.  These Zoom
sessions are only available to affected students and are protected by a
password which is distributed individually.  Please notify me as soon as you
are affected so I can make arrangements.

## Disability Services Statement

"The Office of Disability Resources and Services (DRS) provides a broad range
of support services to assist students with disabilities. Services include, but
are not limited to, tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters,
adaptive and transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY)
in 216 William Pitt Union or see www.drs.pitt.edu for more computer technology,
Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements, DRS can also assist
students with accessibility to campus housing information."

The instructor will work to the best of their ability to accommodate any issues
arising from a disability that a student has, but he must be aware of it in
order to accommodate it.  Please inform me as soon as possible if you have a
disability which you think may hinder your success in the course and we (along
with the DRS) should be able to work around it.

## Academic Integrity Statement

Cheating/plagiarism will _not_ be tolerated. Students suspected of violating
the [SCI Academic Integrity
Policy](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/student-resources/policies/academic-integrity-policy)
will receive a minimum sanction of a zero score for the exam or assignment.

Some guidelines:

_1. For unscored in-class exercises, you are allowed (and encouraged) to look
at your classmates' work and discuss it.  If you get ample help for the
exercises, you should rarely need additional help for the deliverables._

_2. For all scored deliverables and exams, viewing the work done by your
classmates (or a 3rd source) before submission is considered cheating.  Aiding
this activity is also considered cheating.  The only exception is your
designated partner for your group projects._

_3. Text or code generated by generative AI such as ChatGPT or CoPilot is
included in the prohibited 3rd source mentioned above.  You should be the sole
originator of all text or code that you submit as part of this class._
